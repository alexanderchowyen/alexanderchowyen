### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Growing up a first generation Guyanese-American, working as a Software Engineer, and being a father of two amazing children has always put me in a different mindset to my peers! A top selector in the warehouse and storage industry, I was well on my way to management. When Covid became more prevalent, I was troubled by how easily I could lose my job. At that time I began to code daily to strengthen my knowledge and practice in different languages. My interest in coding and my drive to provide for my family pushed me to leave my previous job as a warehouse selector during a world-wide crisis. When the pandemic shut the world down, I went from moving boxes to moving lines of code. My passion for learning how things work has helped me to overcome any obstacle and I would love the opportunity to bring that energy to help solve your business challenges.
